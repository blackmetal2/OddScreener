## CRITICAL ISSUES

[SEVERITY: CRITICAL]
Issue: Chart Y-axis labels display floating point precision errors
Location: Market detail page - Probability History chart
Expected: Y-axis should show clean percentages like "94%", "96%", "98%", "100%"
Actual: Y-axis shows "0001%" repeated multiple times, and accessibility tree shows "94.05000000000001%"
Impact: Makes the chart difficult to read and looks unprofessional
Fix: Round percentage values before display using toFixed(2) or Math.round()
---

[SEVERITY: CRITICAL]
Issue: Console warnings about chart dimensions
Location: Market detail page (appears twice per page load)
Expected: No console warnings
Actual: "The width(-1) and height(-1) of chart should be greater than 0, please check the style of the container"
Impact: Indicates potential rendering issues with Recharts ResponsiveContainer
Fix: Ensure chart container has explicit dimensions before Recharts renders

[SEVERITY: HIGH]
Issue: "$0 traders" displays incorrectly with dollar sign
Location: Market detail page header
Expected: "0 traders" or "N/A traders"
Actual: "$0 traders"

Issue: "Unique Traders: $0" shows dollar sign for count
Location: Market detail page - Market Stats sidebar
Expected: "Unique Traders: 0" or "N/A"

[SEVERITY: MEDIUM]

Impact: Minor UX issue
