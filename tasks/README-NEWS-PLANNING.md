## 💡 Key Insights from Planning

### What Makes This Special
- **Not just news** - It's trading intelligence
- **AI-powered** - Summaries, sentiment, impact scores
- **Market-integrated** - Shows which markets are affected
- **Trader-centric** - Built for action, not passive reading

### Why It Will Succeed
1. **Differentiation** - Competitors don't have this
2. **Real value** - Helps traders make better decisions
3. **Fast to market** - 4 weeks to MVP
4. **Low risk** - Can start small, scale up
5. **High ROI** - Estimated 10-25% increase in trades

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Market linking accuracy** - Must be relevant
2. **Performance** - Must load fast (<2s)
3. **Mobile UX** - Must work on phones
4. **AI quality** - Summaries must be helpful
5. **Real-time updates** - Breaking news must be fast

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Don't Skip These:
- ❌ Mobile testing (50%+ users on mobile)
